# AndroidInputDriver
just press connect. the port number is 3939<br/>
the displayed ip address may not work with virtual machines installed/running. just use ipconfig if the ip address is weird<br/>
<br/>
please just build with visual studio. i have no idea if the installer under release works<br/>
to use the installer, unzip and run Add-AppDevPackage.ps1 with powershell. It will open settings and you need to turn on developer mode. There might be some certificate stuff so that might break everything<br/>
